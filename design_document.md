# Human Simulation: Personality and Needs

## 1. Game Overview
"Human Simulation: Personality and Needs" is a text-based simulation game that models human behavior based on the Big Five personality traits and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Players observe and indirectly influence a society of AI-driven humans as they interact, pursue goals, and strive to fulfill their needs.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### 2.1 Human Entities
- Each human has:
  - Name
  - Position (x, y coordinates)
  - Big Five personality traits (OCEAN)
  - Maslow's hierarchy of needs

### 2.2 Personality Traits (OCEAN)
- Openness: Curiosity and willingness to try new experiences
- Conscientiousness: Organization and goal-directed behavior
- Extraversion: Sociability and assertiveness
- Agreeableness: Cooperation and compassion
- Neuroticism: Emotional stability and stress response

### 2.3 Needs Hierarchy
1. Physiological: Food, water, sleep
2. Safety: Security, stability, freedom from fear
3. Belongingness: Love, friendship, intimacy
4. Esteem: Respect, self-esteem, status
5. Self-Actualization: Personal growth, fulfillment

### 2.4 World Simulation
- Grid-based world
- Time progression (real-time)
- Environmental factors affecting needs
- Resources and obstacles

### 2.5 Human Interactions
- Proximity-based interactions
- Personality-driven behavior
- Need fulfillment activities

## 3. Gameplay

### 3.1 Start of Game
- Generate a population of humans
- Randomly distribute humans in the world
- Initialize personality traits and needs

### 3.2 Turn Progression
1. Update world state
2. Human decision-making
3. Movement and interactions
4. Need and trait updates
5. Event occurrence

### 3.3 Player Interaction
- Observe human behavior and statistics
- Introduce environmental changes or events
- Adjust simulation parameters

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 Programming Language and Libraries
- Python
- curses library for ASCII visualization

### 4.2 Key Classes
- Human: Represents individual entities
- World: Manages the simulation environment
- Need: Enum for Maslow's hierarchy
- Trait: Enum for Big Five traits

### 4.3 Algorithms
- Pathfinding for human movement
- Decision-making based on personality and needs
- Interaction outcomes calculation

## 5. User Interface

### 5.1 Main Display
- ASCII grid representing the world
- Humans represented by '@' symbols
- Legend for environmental features

### 5.2 Information Panel
- Selected human's traits and needs
- Overall population statistics
- Current turn/time

### 5.3 Control Panel
- Commands for adjusting simulation parameters
- Event triggering options
- Save/Load functionality

## 6. Expansion Ideas

### 6.1 Advanced Features
- Genetic algorithm for trait inheritance
- Complex social structures (families, communities)

### 6.2 Visualization Upgrades
- Color-coding for traits or needs
- Simple animations for interactions
- Graphical UI overlay

### 6.3 Scenario Editor
- Custom world creation
- Pre-defined human placement
- Scripted events and challenges

## 7. Development Roadmap

1. Basic simulation with traits and needs
2. Implement curses-based visualization
3. Add human interactions and decision-making
4. Introduce environmental factors and events
5. Develop user interface for observation and control
6. Implement save/load functionality
7. Balancing and refinement
8. Advanced features and expansion
